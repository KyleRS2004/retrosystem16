# retrosystem16
This is a learning project for me to explore assembly for bare metal x86.

Long Term Design goals:
+ Fat12 support and memory management capability
+ 16 bit terminal based OS
+ Basic programs designed for the OS
+ (maybe) a custom interpreter or port an open source interpreter over for something like BASIC.

Commands Implemented:
+ "version" prints out version number of program.
+ "bootscreen" prints out the welcome screen.

I can't figure out how to make the jump from the bootloader to the kernel and the more modern easier bootloaders require a level of understanding of C that I just don't have yet. SO for now this project is being paused, maybe outright abandon.  Feel free to fork the project if you want, just keep the fork licensed under gpl v3.
