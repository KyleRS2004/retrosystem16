# retrosystem16
This is a learning project for me to explore assembly for bare metal x86.

Long Term Design goals:
+ Fat12 support and memory management capability
+ 16 bit terminal based OS
+ Basic programs designed for the OS
+ (maybe) a custom interpreter or port an open source interpreter over for something like BASIC.

Currently I have user input saved to a buffer and plan to make it so that can be compared to commands.
I use the nasm assembler.
