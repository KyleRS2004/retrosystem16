# retrosystem16
This is a learning project for me to explore assembly for bare metal x86.
Long Design goals:
+ Command line
+ Fat12 support and memory management capability
+ 16 bit termial based OS

Currently I have user input saved to a buffer and plan to make it so that can be compared to commands.
